        <p>My name is Andreea Ros. I am a medical historian and aspiring software engineer. I am currently learning software engineering with Manchester Codes. </p>
        
        <p> This part of the website is still under construction, but check out the next two sections.</p>

        <h3>My Projects</h3>

        <div id="project1"><h4 class="headline">HTML Scrapbook</h4>
        <div class="project_text">The first project I created for Manchester Codes is an HTML scrapbook. The aim of this project is to use as many different inline and block HTML elements as possible on a single page in order to clearly illustrate how different elements work. The scrapbook is intended to be a reference tool and I hope to grow it over time. Unfortunately, as it turns out, HTML elements are relatively straighforward, but making something look good in CSS is pretty difficult. </div>
        </div>
        <div id="project2"><h4 class="headline">Online portfolio</h4>
        <div class="project_text">My second project is the portfolio page you are reading right now. Unlike the HTML scrapbook (which was quick and straightforward), the portfolio required planning both in terms of visual design and actual code. I am planning to update this as the weeks go by and add more interesting content and exciting features. </div>

        <h3>What is paper marbling?</h3>
        <div class="plain_text"> 
            <p>The images used on this website are taken from <i>The Art of marbling as applied to paper</i> (1881) by C.W. Woolnough. I've always thought that marbled bookends on old books are very beautiful and striking. 
            When trying to come up with a design for this website, I wanted a banner that was relatively abstract, but colourful and ideally with some Victorian flair (I am, unfortunately, a 19th century historian).
            I then remembered paper marbling and came across Woolnough's book and its wonderful illustrations on Wellcome Collection's online <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bmtnccag"><u>archive</u></a>.</p>
            
            <p>Paper marbling is a print making technique, which (as the name suggests) produces images that look like colourful marble. It was first developed in Japan around the 10th century, but it gradually spread throughout Asia and (eventually) to Europe.
            In Europe, paper marbling was particularly popular as a way to decorate bookends. In England specifically, Woolnough's book popularised paper marbling as a handicraft that could be practiced at home. 
            The digitised edition of his book (linked above) containes detailed instructions for how to recreate its designs.</p> 
            <p>Or, you can watch artist Linh My Truong demonstrate paper marbling techniques in <a href="https://youtu.be/qwaLFLbqJQg"><u>this Youtube clip</u></a>.</p>
